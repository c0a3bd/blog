# 20-1018 - Creating a blog using GitHub

This has been a fun project.  The goal was to learn how to create a free blog using only Github.  I'd referenced several articles, but found [this one](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/) to be the most useful.

Another [great reference](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github) used during this project was for github pull request basics.  

And, for markdown basics, check [this article](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) out!

### Lessons learned: 
* Firming up pull requests before goofing on another person's project 
  </br>(sorry about my goof PR while learning, @[jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)!)
* Maintaining a blog using github; this is awesome!
* Reinforcing markdown basics 
* Sharing another view point with the community!

Happy Hacktoberfest everyone!
